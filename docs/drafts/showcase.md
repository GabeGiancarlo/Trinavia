# Showcase Page Design Doc

## Purpose
Demonstrate how AeroVine’s drones transform vineyard management with examples, benefits, and proof. Starts with case studies from the homepage’s “Learn More” link, then expands into detailed applications and value.

## Design and Feel
- **Overall Vibe**: Like a vineyard tour led by a tech-savvy winemaker—warm, grounded, and inspiring, with a quiet confidence in modern tools. It’s less about selling and more about showing, blending the romance of winemaking with the precision of drones.
- **User Experience**: Engaging and digestible—users feel pulled through a narrative, starting with familiar case studies, then exploring broad benefits and specific wins. Scrolling uncovers layers of value, with clear stops to explore.
- **Visual Tone**: Earthy yet sharp—vineyard vistas paired with crisp data visuals or drone stills. Rustic charm (vine rows, golden light) softened by tech clarity (charts, clean sections) makes the complex approachable.
- **Interaction**: Subtle and purposeful—smooth transitions between sections, light hover effects on examples, and a flow that invites exploration without overwhelming.
