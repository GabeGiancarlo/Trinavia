# Catalog Page Design Doc

## Purpose
Showcase AeroVine’s drone solutions—single drones for specific services and fleets for vineyard sizes.

## Design and Feel
- **Overall Vibe**: The page should feel like a blend of a sunlit vineyard and a sleek tech showroom—warm and earthy, yet sharp and innovative. Imagine browsing a winery’s tasting room where each bottle (or drone) promises to elevate your craft, with a subtle hum of modern efficiency in the air.
- **User Experience**: Intuitive and inviting—users should glide through options effortlessly, whether they’re small vineyard owners dipping their toes into drone tech or large operators seeking a full fleet. The layout balances detailed info with quick decision-making, avoiding overwhelm despite the complexity.
- **Visual Tone**: Rustic charm meets precision—think vineyard rows stretching into the distance, paired with clean, structured cards that hint at cutting-edge tools. Subtle nods to wine country (like topographic textures or vine motifs) should weave through, while tech-forward clarity keeps it grounded in purpose.
- **Interaction**: Smooth and engaging—toggling between Single Drones and Fleets feels seamless, filters snap into action, and cards draw the eye with a sense of discovery. It’s less about flashy animations and more about a steady, confident flow that says, “We’ve got you covered.”
