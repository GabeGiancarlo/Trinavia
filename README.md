</div>

Trinavia is a comprehensive platform for vineyard-specialized drone technology, combining cutting-edge precision agriculture with the sophistication of modern winemaking. Our solution provides vineyard operators with advanced data collection, analysis, and monitoring capabilities through drone-based systems.

## Active Projects

### 🛫 Moose UAV Build Project

We are currently developing a 3D-printed fixed-wing UAV platform as a foundational step toward building custom agricultural drones. This project encompasses:

- **Hardware Integration**: Flight controllers, GPS, telemetry systems, and sensor payloads
- **3D Modeling & Manufacturing**: CAD design, additive manufacturing, and material optimization
- **Autonomous Systems**: Flight control algorithms and automated mission planning
- **Sensor Development**: Integration of RGB, spectral, thermal, and LiDAR sensors for agricultural data collection
