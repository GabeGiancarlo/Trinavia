# Trinavia

**Precision Agriculture Solutions for Viticulture**

</div>

Trinavia is a comprehensive platform for vineyard-specialized drone technology, combining cutting-edge precision agriculture with the sophistication of modern winemaking. Our solution provides vineyard operators with advanced data collection, analysis, and monitoring capabilities through drone-based systems.

## Features

- **Drone-Based Monitoring**: Advanced UAV systems for vineyard surveillance and data collection
- **Precision Agriculture Analytics**: Real-time crop health assessment and yield prediction
- **Water Stress Management**: Comprehensive irrigation optimization using thermal imaging
- **Disease Detection**: Early identification of vine diseases through computer vision
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Integration of multiple data sources for informed decision making

## Project Status

- **Design**: In development (Brand assets and UI mockups complete)
- **Research**: Comprehensive viticulture and drone technology research completed
- **Development**: Platform architecture and implementation in progress
- **Mobile & Web**: Cross-platform development planned
